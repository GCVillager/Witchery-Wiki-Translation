   <p>Infernal chalk is used to draw each of the red infernal glyphs that make up an infernal circle. Infernal chalk and glyphs have a strong affinity with the Nether dimension and rites involving them will often concern fire or demons.
</p>
   <p>
To draw an infernal glyph, use the chalk on the ground. Infernal glyphs of various types will be drawn, although they all have the same function. If you use the chalk on an existing glyph, a new one will be drawn in its place.</p>
   <p>Infernal glyphs should be arranged in the roughly circular patterns as illustrated in the book [[Witchcraft: Circle Magic]].</p>
   <p>Infernal chalk is crafted from netherwart, blaze powder and ritual chalk.</p>
   <p>Recipe prior to version 0.21.0</p>
