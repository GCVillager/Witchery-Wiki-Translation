Baba Yaga's Hat

Defeating Baba Yaga will allow her hat to be acquired. This hat is curious in that it adds 25% to the chance to create a second  when brewing with a kettle, and additionally it gives a 25% to create a third brew!

击败芭芭雅嘎将有机会获得她的帽子。这顶帽子奇怪在当它用水壶酿造时可以增加 25% 的创造第二个酿造（药水？）的概率，另外它提供 25%的机会去创造第三个酿造！

When brewing with a Witches' Cauldron, the hat will give significantly more bottled brews when worn by a very skilled witch (it can double the number of bottles in such cases).

当使用巫师炼药锅时，这顶帽子在被非常熟练的巫师穿戴后可以给予明显更多的瓶装药水（在此情况下它可以将瓶子数量翻倍）。

The hat will also try to keep its wearer out of harms way. If the player is infused, it will occasionally teleport the player a short distance away from harm at the cost of some infusion energy.



In all other respects the hat behaves like other witches hats, being reparable with Impregnated Leather and providing the same defense as leather armor.
